Question:

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        return s.length() - s.lastIndexOf(" ") - 1;
    }
}

Explanation:

s = s.trim(); -> This line removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the input string s.
s.length() - s.lastIndexOf(" ") - 1; -> Calculates the length of the last word by subtracting the 
                                      index of the last space from the total length of the trimmed 
									  string and then subtracting an additional 1.
